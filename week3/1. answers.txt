sort1 uses: bubble sort

How do you know?: On sorted inputs, sort1 is much faster than sort3, consistent with bubble sort’s early-exit behavior when no swaps are needed.

sort2 uses: merge sort

How do you know?: On larger inputs, sort2 runs much faster than the others, consistent with merge sort’s O(n log n) performance.

sort3 uses: selection sort

How do you know?: Its runtime does not improve much on already-sorted input compared to the others, consistent with selection sort’s fixed number of comparisons regardless of initial order.
